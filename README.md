# LXD images

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drubb/lxd-images.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drubb/lxd-images)

> Travis CI builds are currently broken for this project. The reason is LXD depending on an upstream repository that
dropped support for Ubuntu Trusty (14.04), which happens to be the latest version Travis CI supplies
as build environment. Sorry for any inconveniences.
